# Three-card-monte
A game, traditionally associated with confidence tricksters, in which bets are made on which is the queen among three cards lying face downwards.

THREE-CARD MONTE :
Three-card monte is a common scam played on gullible tourists and other easy marks. Three playing cards, one of which is the “red lady” Queen of Hearts, are put facedown on a cardboard box. The dealer quickly rearranges the cards and then asks the mark to pick the Queen of Hearts. But the dealer can use all sorts of tricks to hide the card or otherwise cheat, guaranteeing that the victim never wins.
